If your Bug report is effective, then its chances of getting fixed are higher. So fixing a bug depends upon how effectively you report it.

### Bug Overview
The example application GitLab. We can create a blank project with the below URL 
Create a new blank project: https://gitlab.com/projects/new#blank_project

Hypothetically **Let's assume** that one of the developers has changed the code and instead of text "Create blank project" he has done typo mistakes like "Create black project"

Please refer to below image **instead of blank = black**
